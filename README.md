# ParabolicGrenadeScript
ParabolicGrenadeScript is a Unity script designed for simulating a parabolic grenade trajectory. This script allows an object (the grenade) to follow a parabolic path to reach a specified target point. It includes functionality to visualize the grenade's trajectory in the Unity editor and handle explosion effects upon reaching the target.
