# Project Title
ParabolicGrenadeScript is a Unity script designed for simulating a parabolic grenade trajectory. This script allows an object (the grenade) to follow a parabolic path to reach a specified target point. It includes functionality to visualize the grenade's trajectory in the Unity editor and handle explosion effects upon reaching the target.


## Features

- Parabolic Trajectory: Computes and moves the grenade along a parabolic path.

- Gizmo Visualization: Visualizes the grenade's trajectory in the Unity editor for debugging purposes.
- Explosion Effect: Triggers an explosion effect upon reaching the target.
- Customization: Adjustable peak height of the trajectory and number of resolution points for the trajectory visualization.

## Usage/Examples

```
Attach the Script: Attach the ParabolicGrenadeScript to a GameObject that represents the grenade.

Configure the Script:

Set the target variable to the GameObject representing the target.

- Adjust peakHeight to control the arc of the trajectory.

- Modify gravity if you need a different gravitational effect.

- Set resolution to control the smoothness of the trajectory visualization.

- Assign the explosionPrefab with the explosion effect you want to use.

- Play the Scene: When you play the scene, the grenade will follow a parabolic path towards the target and explode upon reaching it.

- Visualize the Trajectory: Enable the isGizmos flag to visualize the trajectory in the Unity editor.
